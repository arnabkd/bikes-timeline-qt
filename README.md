# Welcome to BikeRack Visualization 

## Background
My master's thesis involves using machine learning to predict traffic patterns in bikeshare systems across the globe. As part of that work, I have a dataset for the bikeshare system in Oslo (currently operated by ClearChannel), along with datasets for London, New York, Washington D.C. and Chicago, IL. 

## The app
This app shows a visual representation of the dataset mentioned above.

## Usage
1. Compile the application and launch it.
2. Uncompress the zip files in the `example-data` folder.
3. In the app, browse to one of the sub-folders under the `example-data` folder.
4. Click "Ok" and wait for the dataset to be loaded.
5. Click play (or press the spacebar) and enjoy the animation!
