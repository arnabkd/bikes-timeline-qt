As part of that work, I have a dataset for the bikeshare system in Oslo (currently operated by ClearChannel), along with datasets for London, New York, Washington D.C. and Chicago, IL. \r\n\r\n## The app\r\nThis app shows a visual representation of the dataset mentioned above.\r\n\r\n## Usage\r\n1. Compile the application and launch it.\r\n2. Uncompress the zip files in the `example-data` folder.\r\n3. In the app, browse to one of the sub-folders under the `example-data` folder.\r\n4. Click \"Ok\" and wait for the dataset to be loaded.\r\n5. Click play (or press the spacebar) and enjoy the animation!\r\n\r\n## Screenshots\r\n\r\n<br />\r\n<img src=\"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/arnabkd/bikes-timeline-qt/gh-pages/screenshots/pre-morning-rush.png\" width=400,height=300 />\r\n<br />\r\nFigure: Pre morning rush visualization of London bike racks\r\n\r\n<br />\r\n<img src=\"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/arnabkd/bikes-timeline-qt/gh-pages/screenshots/after-morning-rush.png\"\r\nwidth=400,height=300 />\r\n<br />\r\nFigure: Post morning rush visualization of London bike racks\r\n\r\n\r\n## Credits\r\n* Based on Qt by Digia\r\n* Data collection for Oslo done by Martin Stensg√•rd @mastensg\r\n* Thanks to the [PyBikes project](https://github.com/eskerda/PyBikes), which helped me gather data for a number of bikeshare systems around the world.\r\n* Developed by @arnabkd\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
